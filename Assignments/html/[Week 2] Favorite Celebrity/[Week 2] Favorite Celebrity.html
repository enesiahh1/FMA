        Dayvon Daquan Bennett (August 9, 1994 – November 6, 2020), known professionally as King Von, was an American
        gangsta rapper from Chicago, Illinois. He was signed to Lil Durk's record label Only the Family and Empire
        Distribution. During Bennett's life, and after his killing, he was implicated in various homicides and alleged
        crimes related to the Chicago gang scene. On November 6th, 2020, he was shot and killed at age 26.

        Bennett garnered acclaim for singles "Crazy Story" and "Took Her to the O", which reached the forty-fourth
        position of the Billboard Hot 100, and for the studio album Welcome to O'Block (2020), which placed fifth on the
        Billboard 200.

            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>Bennett was born on August 9, 1994, in Chicago, Illinois.He had six half-siblings from his father, Walter
                E. Bennett, and three siblings from his mother, Taesha. He was raised mostly by his mother; his
                relationship with his father was inconsistent due to his father's incarcerations. When Von was 11 years
                old his father was killed by an unseen gunman. Von would later pay tribute to him in multiple songs.

                At age 16, Von went to jail for the first time. In 2014, he was charged with one count of first degree
                murder and two counts of attempted murder in connection with a shooting that killed one and injured two
                others.After being acquitted of all charges, Von began focusing on his music career, collaborating with
                Lil Durk. Before his arrest for the charges, he attended South Suburban College in South Holland,
                Illinois. He earned his GED while in juvenile detention. During this time, he joined the Black Disciples
                street gang.</p>
