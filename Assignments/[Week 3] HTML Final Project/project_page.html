            <h2 id="project2">Happy wheels</h2>
            <p>Happy Wheels is a ragdoll physics-based platform browser game developed and published by Fancy Force.
                Created in 2010 by video game designer Jim Bonacci, the game features several player characters using
                various and often atypical vehicles to traverse the game's many user-generated levels. The game is best
                known for its graphic violence and the amount of user-generated content its players produce on a regular
                basis, with game maps shared on a public server. A sequel has been announced to be in development since
                2019.</p>
